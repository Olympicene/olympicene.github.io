Hello and welcome to my blog! I've been meaning to make one of these for a long time but I never really felt like the internet needed another opinionated person with a functional keyboard. I still kinda feel that way. But for the past two years or so I've been browsing [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/) in lieu of reddit and I've had a renewed sense of hope for internet discourse. Not enough hope to enable comments on this blog any time soon but hope regardless. 

## Goals of this Blog

In terms of goals I have absolutely no goals.

In an ideal world I would have wanted this to be a technical blog but *unfortunately* I have no technical information to share at this time. Until I finally get into the weeds of software development this may be more of a journal where I point out some cool projects/websites I stumble upon on the branching path to becoming more technical programmer.

Although that isn't to say that I don't have any plans. I plan to show off and explain a few of my projects that I have in the works on here as well. However given my track record on finishing those projects we'll see about that. 

## Inspiration

As previously mentioned I am really stubborn about finishing projects. So I find it really important to thank anyone and everything that inspired me to finish this website.

In terms of people I'd like to thank my ART 151 Professor. His class reminded me why I started programming in the first place: to have fun. I'd also like to thank all my friends for giving me ideas for projects and motivating me throughout the years. 

And here's a bunch of websites I was inspired by/stole ideas from:
- [https://ttntm.me/](https://ttntm.me/)
- [https://ben.page/](https://ben.page/)
- [https://ciechanow.ski/](https://ciechanow.ski/)
- [http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/)
- [https://aboutideasnow.com/](https://aboutideasnow.com/)

## Closing Remarks

I know not a lot of people will visit this website, much less this blog but it still feels a bit scary putting it out there. I'm excited to get frankly any sort of  attention but I hate the idea of being perceived. Reminded me of a quote I saw earlier today:

<blockquote>
    "The need to be desired and the abhorrence of being known"<br>
    &mdash; <cite>some dude on discord</cite>
</blockquote>

I swear he made it up on the spot I cannot find a source anywhere else.

Anyway, thanks for reading this far, hope you stick along for the ride. Here's a little meme as a treat and also because I have too many to not share.
